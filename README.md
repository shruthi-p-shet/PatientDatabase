# Patient Database

A fully functional project written Java to store and manage Patients data in hospitals.

The project is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the front end and the Java Spring Boot framework for the back end. A MySQL database is utilized to store the patient data. For this project, I have made it possible for users to add patient data, update previously entered data, and viewÂ all database-stored data. They may even remove data if it is not needed.
