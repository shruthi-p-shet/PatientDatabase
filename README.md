# PatientDatabase
A fully functional project written in Java to store and manage Patients data in hospitals.
---
The project is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the front end and the Java Spring Boot framework for the back-end. A MySQL database is utilized to store the patient data. From this project I have made it possible for users to add patient data, update previously entered data, and viewÂ all database-stored data. They may even remove data if it is not needed.
